## i have two systems, a pc and a laptop, i primarly use the latter for coding and browsing
### configurations
#### laptop: nixos, gnome/sway/hyprland
#### desktop: debian, gnome

##### i try to not overcomplicate my configurations so i don't make them modular or care too much about pretty code on them
##### i only maintain this repository for my personal use and not for third party use, although it is not prohibited (let me know if you do so!)
---
### tools i use (not limited to)
- kitty terminal
- ghostty
- neovim
- vscode
- zed
- intelij
- zsh
- brave browser
- firefox
##### other specific pkgs are available in each module for the specific WM/DE, or in the general configurations.nix file
